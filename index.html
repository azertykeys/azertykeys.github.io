        <h2>Sniff</h2>
        <h3>10/6/21</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          From where you're sitting I hear a sniff. I don't know. I'm too noticing in some ways and completely oblivious in others. But I think, that sniff wasn't snot. But that doesn't matter. I know you just had a 12 hour day working on set, that you're spending a couple minutes on the couch on the phone, adjacent an old and a new roommate embroidering.

        </p>
       
        <p>
          What I don't know is what to do. The first sniff I can dismiss. I'm the new roommate. I've spent maybe 30 minutes in your company. How comfortable are you? How comfortable are the two of us together? I feel like I know something about you because I've heard your voice, I've talked with you a little and have heard you phrase things, heard you relate ideas, heard your puns and laugh. But not so long.        </p>
<p> When the second and third sniffs come drifting piercingly from your couch, I can't help but feel an overwhelming urge to get up and offer you a hug. It's painful how much I feel this obligation. Desire. I long to feel what I've felt before when friends and family have accepted a needed comforting hug. The permeating relief and warmth. 
</p>
        <p>
          But I don't get up. I don't want to compromise a new relationship. I don't want to break boundaries that I don't see. Hell, I'm not even sure it was really a tear-sniff. It's fall, after all, and colds abound. So I finish embroidering a cute little oak leaf onto my hat, and start on a heart. It'll have a perforated black outline. I hope to get up for you next time.

      <h2>Opposites</h2>
      <h3>5/7/21</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        When I was a kid, the way people used “opposites” bugged me (weird kid, I know). 
        Like, black couldn’t possibly be the opposite of white - they’re both colors! And I would apply that logic to all sorts of “opposites.” 
        Happy vs. sad? Emotions. Day vs. Night? Periods of time. 
        For some reason, it didn’t click that opposites are opposites because they oppose one another.
      </p>
     
      <p>
        Opposites must be applied to related terms. On what axis would things be unrelated anyhow? It’s similar to the problem of randomness - Our brains work through connections, so making unconnections is impossible. At the very least, we have to be able to describe it with language. If one doesn’t make that distinction, then the opposite of a describable thing would be indescribable and abstract. I don’t see people talking about the opposite of a dog being *indistinct eldritch moaning*. After all, we’re trying to make sense by speaking the same language, right? You know, relating to one another by way of communication?
      </p>
      <p>So in our quest for sharing, we choose our axes of meaning. In language we often use the shape and behavior of physical forms to express abstract concepts. In the case of opposites, we require a body with two ends. A coin satisfies, but it implicates a binary and a spatial closeness. A middle is helpful. So: a line. 3D-wise, one might describe it as a pole. And, yes, it has a pair of poles. Perhaps this body could be useful for describing polar opposites.
      </p>
      <p>
        I argue the middle is the most interesting part of the construction. There is so much room for poetic expression. There are no perfectly good or perfectly evil people. The darkest part of the night is but an infinitesimal blip that passes by without a hitch in the march of the sun. And who’s ever been perfectly happy? No, it’s the planet in between the south and north poles that’s worth exploring, the gooey mantle surrounded by an endlessly diverse and evolving crust. Not the abstractions at either end.
     </p>
       <p>
        I’ve changed my mind. I really quite like opposites now. Not for their own sake, but rather what their constructed opposition tells us about how we situate ourselves and our world. Only by teasing apart the abstract from the concrete can we reconstruct a healthier and more wholistic view of the world. Why keep men masculine and women feminine? Humans are great at varying their expression. Why pit nature and humanity against one another? Humans are a part of nature. Why pretend land and sea are so far from one another? Humans have always been diving in :)      </p>
